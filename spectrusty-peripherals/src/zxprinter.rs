//! An emulator of the family of printers: **ZX Printer** / **Alphacom 32** / **Timex TS2040**.
//!
//! **ZX Printer** is an extremely compact, 32 column printer which uses an aluminum-coated paper.
//! The printed image is being burned onto the surface of the paper by two metal pins that travel
//! across the paper. A voltage is passed through these pins which cause a spark to be produced,
//! leaving a black-ish (or blue-ish) dot.
//!
//! The Alphacom 32 is compatible with software for the ZX Printer but uses thermal paper instead
//! of the ZX Printer's metalized paper.
//!
//! ZX Printer used special 4" (100 mm) wide black paper which was supplied coated with a thin layer of aluminum.
//!
//! Alphacom 32 printer's thermographic paper has 4.33" (110 mm) x 1.9" (48 mm) diameter.
//! 
//! TS2040 was a branded version of Alphacom 32 distributed by Timex to the US.
//!
//! See [Printers](https://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/peripherals.htm#Printers).

# Memory banks and pages.

* [ZxMemory] ROM and RAM is a continuous slice of memory divided into logical banks.
* 16-bit memory addresses are mapped to memory banks depending on the implementation.
* Each page can have any fitting bank of ROM or RAM switched in.
* Some implementations allow attaching an external ROM bank to any of the pages.

Below are examples of continuous memory: all ROM banks followed by RAM banks.
[ZxMemory::mem_ref] and [ZxMemory::mem_mut] both give access to the whole area.
